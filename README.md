# Password-manager
Password management tool using flask.

For me, itâ€™s very difficult to remember a lot of passwords. So, I just made this flask program to help me remember and the passwords. It can also be used to generate passwords of a specified length.

### Algorithm principle

python random, md5

### How to use

You should install Flask in your python virtual environment first. Then run the app.py or use 'flask run' command.

You can deploy it to your linux server to make it more useful, it's up to you!

Or, If you just want to run it locally, just run the generate.py. But remember to edit the parameters in it.
